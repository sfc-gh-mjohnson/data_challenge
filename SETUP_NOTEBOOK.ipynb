        "# Setup Notebook - Shared Library Installation\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose\n",
        "This notebook sets up a shared Python package directory that can be used across all notebooks in this workspace.\n",
        "\n",
        "## ⚠️ Important Notes\n",
        "1. **Run this notebook first** before running any other notebooks in the workspace\n",
        "2. **Re-run after service restarts**: The `/workspace` directory is not persistent across container service restarts\n",
        "3. Service restarts can occur:\n",
        "   - During weekend maintenance\n",
        "   - After idle timeout (default 1 hour)\n",
        "   - Manual service restarts\n",
        "4. If other notebooks fail with import errors, re-run this notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture\n",
        "Instead of each notebook maintaining its own virtual environment, we:\n",
        "1. Create a shared directory: `/workspace/site-packages_shared`\n",
        "2. Install all required packages once into this directory\n",
        "3. Add this directory to Python's path in each notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits\n",
        "- Install packages once, use across all notebooks\n",
        "- Faster notebook startup times\n",
        "- Consistent package versions across notebooks\n",
        "- Reduced storage usage\n",
        "\n",
        "## Risks\n",
        "- No per-notebook environment isolation\n",
        "- Package version conflicts if different notebooks need different versions\n",
        "- Must re-run after service restarts (packages are not persistent)\n"
